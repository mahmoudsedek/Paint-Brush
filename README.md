# Paint-Brush
## "This was done on November 2020 during the academic period of ITI"
Paint Brush is simple project implemented in Java it's like the paint in our Windows where you can draw:
1-free hand.  2-Rectangular.  3-Circle.   4-Square.
you can also choose the color you want to draw with, beside having an ERASER to delete whatever you want.
and finally the magic button of UNDO.

#Steps to run:
this was written using notepad++ only so you're gonna compile it and run the old fashioned way:'D
make sure you go to the directory contains the .java file and open a CMD terminal then type " ** javac PaintBrush.java ** "
if it compiles successfuly without throwing any errors "no news is good news" that means your byte code is ready and you can run you class.
then " ** appletviewer PaintBrush.html ** " then you'll get a Paint window with the specs in the .html file and enjoy drawing some funny chapes.
